   <h4>
   	<p> Bar16. We have three different pubs in Budapest, in the suburbs. All the members of our founding team have been living in the district since we were kids, and we felt the lack of a proper bar in the district, everyone goes downtown to have fun instead of staying local. Our concept is to have three distinct experiences in our three bars: one located next to the local lookout tower in a grove of trees, and one on the edge of town on the shores of a protected lake. We offer sophisticated drinks and cocktails, always with fresh local beers and ciders on tap. You won't go home without eating, as we offer a variety of snacks. You are welcome! </h4>
